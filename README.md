# Exploratory analyses of sc proteomics data

This package includes two "mini-analyses" of single-cell proteomics data from the BIRS Biointegration hackathon:

1. Transferring cell type labels. Data from different studies, technologies, with:
  - Limited overlap in features
  - No overlap in samples
2. Tumor spatial autocorrelation and clinical prognosis
